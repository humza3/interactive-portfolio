						<h3 class= "aside-title">About Me</h3>
						<p>
						I am an Economics graduate who is currently studying for a career change into Web development.
						A few years prior, I taught myself how to make websites and android apps by studying Web and app
						development books and utilising online resources. Although my pursuits in web and mobile development
						were at a hobbyist level, in that time I managed to create four websites and nine apps.
						I made the websites with a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, I produced the apps with Java.
						Previously, I worked as a self-employed day trader for three years where I employed my knowledge from
						my university studies in Financial Economics to trade on the share and futures market but after some time,
						I decided that this field was not providing the prosperity that I required in a career. 
						Currently, I am gaining a professional qualification in website development via Openclassrooms
						whilst working full-time at an Amazon Fulfilment Centre.
